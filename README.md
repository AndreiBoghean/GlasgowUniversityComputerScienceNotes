## Changed Course Names:
- Interactive Systems -> HCSDE
- ...

  
## Contribution Guidelines:

In general, structure is:
```
/
└── Full Course Name
    ├── Notes
    ├── Lecture Slides
    │   └── 2025fcmSlides.pdf
    └── Etc
```
Where fcm is the shorter name of the course (think tad from text as data).

In the case of a course changing name, please make a reference here, but dont change the contents of the folder, only the "top level" folder name.

If you want to just add content, this can be trunk based, but any large scale changes (i.e. modifying files/folders, not just adding), should be a PR.
